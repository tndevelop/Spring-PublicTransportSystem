# Spring-PublicTransportSystem-Tmp

This is a full Back End system for handling a Public Transport Company's system. The system handles the tickets (provides the apis for buying tickets, paying for them and validating them when they are used). 

## Technologies

The system is written in Kotlin using various tools from the Spring suite (Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Boot and Spring WebFlux), Kotlin Coroutines and Kafka.

## repository limits

This report is a temporary solution to show the work, while we figure out a way to securely publish the original repository with all the original commits. In fact some files have to be removed entirely from the original repository's history (as the original repo was not intended to be public in the first place).
